# A collection of python small python scripts.

This is just a small collection of small python scripts that I made to learn the language, everything is licensed under the MIT license
and you can use it as you want.

However, this repository is still unfinished, there are still some things to do.

## Pending

- A script to count files inside a folder.
- Fix task_assign.py
